# Project and Hierarchy Representation

We will use multi-layer structure and show the initial hierarchy using polygons at each layer. 

*  Project is a triangle, 
*  Head of project is a square,
*  layer n is an (n+2)-gon ...

But actually, different people may occupy different levels in different projects, so maybe just
using corcles is better.
